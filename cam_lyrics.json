[  "[Verse 1]\nLet me paint you the picture, it’ll be just like a movie\nFeel like the Princess your daddy always called ya\nHere you come now unbeknownst, and let me take your coat\nProvider of the spectacle you yearn for...\n[Chorus]...\nAnother taste another night",  "[Verse 1]\nAnswers, like obituaries, carved in stone\nCancers, of the mind in body...\n[Chorus]...\nWe’re broken machines",
  "[Intro]\nEntropy, will sedition breach the walls of the machine?...\nRelease, the hold of the old. I’m torn between two minds",
  "[Verse 1]\nThe mind inside the mind’s not mine...\n[Bridge 2]...\nBlackened light, decide, to shine, for once please be bright",
  "[Chorus]\nI’m just saying that, you could have been a better man...\n[Bridge]...\nNever fly",
  "[Verse]\nClaim this my cowardice,\nAnd I will, I will own it...\nCome let us tear ourselves apart",
  "[Chorus]\nLet’s steal stripper’s car tonight...\nBaby you and I",
  "[Chorus]\nTear away the bygone...\nBehold the godless age",
  "[Verse 1]\nDissipated, emasculated...\nI’ll battle and bleed alone, so you’ll never need to",
  "[Verse 1]\nPull me current\nNo ballast, I have no way...\nWhat's my use to this world\nwithout you?",
  "[Verse 1]\nGirl come take off your skin...\nLet’s find out who we really are",
  "[Verse 1]\nWe first met at the danger scene...\nYou came to me close",
  "[Verse]\nWake up, wake up, I hear the sound...\nNone can question me any longer",
  "[Intro]\nSlow down, we’ve lost control...\nYou’ll find no stillness in our rage",
  "[Verse 1]\nCall it arrogance, call it juvenile...\nNo one can follow now",
  "[Intro]\nI’ve got a doubting mind to convince...\nI know little more than I’m not one you",
  "[Verse 1]\nWith The lights all off, the crowds have gone...\nIt never lies",
  "[Verse 1]\nI’m just another bead on the necklace...\nReach for the stars"
